# FreeCodeCamp Responisve Web Design Projects

The goal of these projects is to use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have covered so far and it is good to get some practice with plain CSS. For this reason I will not be using Bootstrap or SASS.
