            <h2>How does it work?</h2>

            <h3>Step One: The Initial Meeting</h3>
            The first meeting with Dr. Mierzwiak serves primarily as an introductory meeting where the patient will be given a tour of the facility and a chance to meet the staff. After that, the patient will sit down for a consultation with Dr. Mierzwiak. While the possibilities for this procedure are endless, it is important that the patient and the doctor have a full understanding of each other's expectations for the patient's personal case. This helps the Lacuna team tailor the procedure to best serve the patient.
            
            <h3>Step Two: Preparing for the procedure</h3>
            After a patient decides of the specifics of what memory he/she is going to have erased, there is some initial preparation that goes into a successful procedure. The patient is instructed to collect any items or mementos that have any ties to the memory that is being targeted. These items will be used by the Lacuna team during and disposed of following the procedure. This is to ensure that the patient won't have any unexplainable items after the memory erasure.
            
            <h3>Step Three: Mapping the memory</h3>
            The team of Lacuna technicians will use the information they have received and the items brought in by the patient to create a map of the memory. They will then use this map to extract the memory from the patients mind.
            
            <h3>Step Four: The Procedure</h3>
            Following the map created specifically for every patient, Dr. Mierzwiak and his team will begin to erase the targeted memory. The procedure works on a reverse timeline, which means it begins with the most recent memories and goes backwards in time. This approach is designed to target the emotional core that every memory builds on. By eradicating the core, Dr. Mierzwiak is able to make the entire memory dissolve. When the patient wakes up from the surgery, they remember nothing.
            
            Due to the nature of this procedure, there is virtually no need for post-operative treatment.
