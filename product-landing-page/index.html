            Charlie Phan was only 14 when he left his home in Antarctica and set
            out for America. He was a smart kid but traveling the seas is always
            a challenge. He paid his way by cutting the hair of the ship's crew.
            However, in an unfortunate series of events, the ship got lost at
            sea. Many of the crew members claimed that the reason was for the
            captain's poor navigation was because he was so impressed with his
            haircut that he wouldn't stop looking at himself in the mirror.
            After traveling on the sea for about 2 years, the ship managed to go
            through the Bermuda Triangle, twice.

            It was through his wormhole to another dimension that Charlie was
            able to master the art of cutting hair. It is also in this next
            dimension where he met his wife Kathy. Charlie and Kathy returned
            but unfortunately arrived in New York. It took them about 15 minutes
            to decide they hated the environment, and especially George
            Steinbrenner's Yankees. After that, they moved to Danville,
            California and have grown Charlie's hair business ever since.
            Charlie cuts hair full time and if you're lucky, you may see one of
            his friends from another galaxy stop by for the most famous haircut
            in the universe, literally.
