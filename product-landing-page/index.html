                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>Lacuna Inc. is the brainchild of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak, who after years of dedicated research has developed a cutting-edge, non-surgical procedure for the focused erasure of troubling memories. Dr. Mierzwiak received his Ph.D. in Neuroscience from Yale University in 1980 and has worked at numerous top-tier organizations where he has made many revolutionary discoveries on the topic of memory.</p>

                <p>Lacuna Inc. was founded in 2003 to provide a state of the art research facility for the development of this procedure. Over the years, the project has progressed from a mere idea into a full-blown medical service, and Lacuna Inc. has grown right along with it. Now a full service clinic with a highly trained staff, Lacuna is just starting to tap into its potential.</p>
                
                <p>With tens of thousands of satisfied customers already, Lacuna Inc. has established a strong reputation in the medical community. Our procedure is offered to men and women of all ages, and it is perfectly safe, quick, and painless. We pride ourselves on our impeccable and 100% guaranteed descretion.</p>

                <h2>The Process</h2>
                <h3>STEP ONE: CONSULTATION</h3>
                <p>This meeting serves as an introduction to the facility and the staff. You will be given a tour of our state of the art facility and will get to sit down with Dr. Mierzwiak in person. Here is your chance to ask any questions you may have about the procedure. The Doctor will then ask a series of questions so that there is a clear understanding of your wishes and expectations.</p>

                <h3>STEP TWO: PREPARATION FOR THE PROCEDURE</h3>
                <p>If you decide to move forward, there are a series of tasks you must complete to ensure a successful procedure. This includes collecting any and all items or mementoes that tie to the targeted memory. You will bring these with you on the day of your procedure and our technicians will dispose of them properly.</p>

                <h3>STEP THREE: MEMORY MAPPING</h3>
                <p>Our technicians will construct a custom map of the memory we will be targeting. This aids us in the flawless extraction of your memory. Upon your approval, we can move forward with scheduling an appointment for the procedure.</p>

                <h3>STEP FOUR: THE PROCEDURE</h3>
                <p>The procedure uses our patented reverse timeline technique, which erases memories from most recent to the most historic and targets the emotional core that the memory builds upon. The prodecure is preformed by our technicians at your own home. The memories are essentially dissolved, and you will remember nothing of the procedure upon waking in their own bed.</p>
