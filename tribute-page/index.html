                    <h3>Early life: 1901–1920</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Walt Disney was born on December 5, 1901, at 1249 Tripp Avenue, in Chicago's Hermosa neighborhood.</li>
                        <li>In 1906, when Disney was four, the family moved to a farm in Marceline, Missouri, where his uncle Robert had just purchased land.</li>
                        <li>In 1911, the Disneys moved to Kansas City, Missouri.</li>
                        <li>In 1917, Elias bought stock in a Chicago jelly producer, the O-Zell Company, and moved back to the city with his family.</li>
                        <li>In mid-1918, Disney attempted to join the United States Army to fight against the Germans, but he was rejected for being too young. After forging the date of birth on his birth certificate, he joined the Red Cross in September 1918 as an ambulance driver.</li>
                        <li>Disney returned to Kansas City in October 1919, where he worked as an apprentice artist at the Pesmen-Rubin Commercial Art Studio. There he befriended fellow artist Ub Iwerks.</li>

                    <h3>Early career: 1920–1928</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In January 1920, as Pesmen-Rubin's revenue declined after Christmas, Disney and Iwerks were laid off. They started their own business, the short-lived Iwerks-Disney Commercial Artists.</li>
                        <li>In May 1921, Walt and a co-worker from the Film Ad Co, Fred Harman established Laugh-O-Gram Studio.</li>
                        <li>Laugh-O-Gram Studio produced Alice's Wonderland‍—‌based on Alice's Adventures in Wonderland‍—‌which combined live action with animation.  The result, a 12-and-a-half-minute, one-reel film, was completed too late to save Laugh-O-Gram Studio, which went into bankruptcy, and then Disney moved to Hollywood in July 1923.</li>
                        <li>In October of 1923, Disney and his brother Roy signed a contract with New York film distributor Margaret J. Winkler for six Alice comedies. They formed the Disney Brothers Studio‍—‌which later became The Walt Disney Company‍—‌to produce the films.</li>
                        <li>In July 1924, Disney also hired Iwerks, persuading him to relocate to Hollywood from Kansas City.</li>
                        <li>Early in 1925, Disney hired an ink artist, Lillian Bounds. They married in July of that year, at her brother's house in her hometown of Lewiston, Idaho.</li>
                        <li>Walt and Lillian's marriage produced two daughters, Diane (born December 1933) and Sharon (adopted in December 1936, born six weeks previously)</li>
                        <li>By 1926 Winkler's role in the distribution of the Alice series had been handed over to her husband, the film producer Charles Mintz.</li>
                        <li>The series ran until July 1927, by which time Disney had begun to tire of it and wanted to move away from the mixed format to all animation. After Mintz requested new material to distribute through Universal Pictures, Disney and Iwerks created Oswald the Lucky Rabbit.</li>
                        <li>In February 1928, Disney hoped to negotiate a larger fee for producing the Oswald series, but found Mintz wanting to reduce the payments. Disney also found out that Universal owned the intellectual property rights to Oswald. Disney refused to accept the reductions of payment and lost most of his animation staff to Mintz, except Iwerks, who chose to remain with him.</li>

                    <h3>Creation of Mickey Mouse to the first Academy Awards: 1928–1933</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To replace Oswald, Disney and Iwerks developed Mickey Mouse. Mickey Mouse first appeared in May 1928 as a single test screening of the short Plane Crazy,  but it, and the second feature, The Gallopin' Gaucho, failed to find a distributor.</li>
                        <li>Following the 1927 sensation The Jazz Singer, Disney used synchronized sound on the third short, Steamboat Willie, to create the first post-produced sound cartoon. After the animation was complete, Disney signed a contract with the former executive of Universal Pictures, Pat Powers, and Powers' Cinephone became the new distributor for Disney's early sound cartoon.</li>
                        <li>Disney hired the professional composer and arranger Carl Stalling, on whose suggestion the Silly Symphony series was developed, providing stories through the use of music; the first in the series, The Skeleton Dance (1929), was drawn and animated entirely by Iwerks. Also hired at this time were several local artists, some of whom stayed with the company as core animators; the group later became known as the Nine Old Men.</li>
                        <li>Disney and his brother felt they were not receiving their rightful share of profits from Powers. In 1930, Disney tried to trim costs from the process by urging Iwerks to abandon the practice of animating every separate cel in favor of the more efficient technique of drawing key poses and letting lower-paid assistants sketch the inbetween poses.</li>
                        <li>Powers refused Disney's request for an increase in payments for the cartoons and signed Iwerks to work for him; Stalling resigned shortly afterwards, thinking that without Iwerks, the Disney Studio would close. Disney had a nervous breakdown in October 1931‍—‌which he blamed on the machinations of Powers and his own overwork‍—‌so he and Lillian took an extended holiday to Cuba and a cruise to Panama to recover.</li>
                        <li>With the loss of Powers as distributor, Disney studios signed a contract with Columbia Pictures to distribute the Mickey Mouse cartoons, which became increasingly popular, including internationally. Disney, always keen to embrace new technology, filmed Flowers and Trees (1932) in full-color three-strip Technicolor.  Flowers and Trees was popular with audiences and won the Academy Award for best Short Subject (Cartoon) at the 1932 ceremony. </li>
                        <li>In 1933, Disney produced The Three Little Pigs, a film described by the media historian Adrian Danks as "the most successful short animation of all time". The film won Disney another Academy Award in the Short Subject (Cartoon) category.</li>

                    <h3>Golden age of animation: 1934–1941</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>By 1934, Disney had become dissatisfied with producing formulaic cartoon shorts, and the studio began the four-year production of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, based on the fairy tale. The film, which was the first animated feature made in full color and sound, cost $1.5 million to produce‍—‌three times over budget.</li>
                        <li>A Silly Symphony called The Old Mill (1937)‍—‌won the Academy Award for Animated Short Film because of its impressive visual power from the multiplane camera developed by Disney's animators which allowed drawings on pieces of glass to be set at various distances from the camera, creating an illusion of depth.</li>
                        <li>Snow White premiered in December 1937 to high praise from critics and audiences. The film became the most successful motion picture of 1938 and by May 1939 its total gross of $6.5 million made it the most successful sound film made to that date.</li>
                        <li>With work on Snow White finished, the studio began producing Pinocchio in early 1938 and Fantasia in November of the same year.</li>
                        <li>Pinocchio and Fantasia were released in 1940, and neither performed well at the box office‍—‌partly because revenues from Europe had dropped following the start of World War II in 1939. The studio made a loss on both pictures and was deeply in debt by the end of February 1941</li>
                        <li>Disney's sometimes high-handed and insensitive manner of dealing with staff, led to a 1941 animators' strike which lasted five weeks. While a federal mediator from the National Labor Relations Board negotiated with the two sides, Disney accepted an offer from the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs to make a goodwill trip to South America, ensuring he was absent during a resolution he knew would be unfavorable to the studio.</li>
                        <li>The studio's next production, Dumbo (1941), which Disney produced in a simple and inexpensive manner received a positive reaction from audiences and critics alike.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>World War II and beyond: 1941–1950</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In December 1941, the U.S. entered World War II. Disney formed the Walt Disney Training Films Unit within the company to produce instruction films for the military such as Four Methods of Flush Riveting and Aircraft Production Methods.</li>
                        <li>Disney also produced several propaganda productions, including shorts such as Der Fuehrer's Face‍—‌which won an Academy Award‍—‌and the 1943 feature film Victory Through Air Power.</li>
                        <li>The military films generated only enough revenue to cover costs, and the feature film Bambi‍—‌which had been in production since 1937‍—‌underperformed on its release in April 1942, and lost $200,000 at the box office.</li>
                        <li>On top of the low earnings from Pinocchio and Fantasia, the company had debts of $4 million with the Bank of America in 1944.</li>
                        <li>Roy Disney, for financial reasons, suggested more combined animation and live-action productions. In 1948, Disney initiated a series of popular live-action nature films, titled True-Life Adventures, with Seal Island the first; the film won the Academy Award in the Best Short Subject (Two-Reel) category.</li>
                        <li>Disney grew more politically conservative as he got older. A Democratic Party supporter until the 1940 presidential election, when he switched allegiance to the Republican Party, he became a generous donor to Thomas E. Dewey's 1944 bid for the presidency.</li>
                        <li>In 1946, he was a founding member of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, an organization who stated they "believ[ed] in, and like, the American Way of Life ... we find ourselves in sharp revolt against a rising tide of Communism, Fascism and kindred beliefs, that seek by subversive means to undermine and change this way of life".</li>
                        <li>In 1947, during the Second Red Scare, Disney testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), where he branded Herbert Sorrell, David Hilberman and William Pomerance, former animators and labor union organizers, as communist agitators.</li>
                        <li>In 1949, Disney and his family moved to a new home in the Holmby Hills district of Los Angeles. With the help of his friends Ward and Betty Kimball, who already had their own backyard railroad, Disney developed blueprints and immediately set to work on creating a miniature live steam railroad for his backyard.</li>

                    <h3>Theme parks, television and other interests: 1950–1966</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In early 1950, Disney produced Cinderella, his studio's first animated feature in eight years. It was popular with critics and theater audiences. Costing $2.2 million to produce, it earned nearly $8 million in its first year.</li>
                        <li>Disney made his first entirely live-action feature, Treasure Island (1950), which was shot in Britain, as was The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men (1952)</li>
                        <li>Disney continued to produce full-length animated features too, including Alice in Wonderland (1951) and Peter Pan (1953).</li>
                        <li>Disney had been considering building a theme park, a clean, unspoiled park, where both children and their parents could have fun. In March 1952 he received zoning permission to build a theme park in Burbank, near the Disney studios. This site proved too small, and a larger plot in Anaheim, 35 miles (56 km) south of the studio, was purchased.</li>
                        <li>Disney formed WED Enterprises (now Walt Disney Imagineering) and used his own money to fund a group of designers and animators to work on the theme park plans. In mid-1954, Disney sent his Imagineers to every amusement park in the U.S. to analyze what worked and what pitfalls or problems there were in the various locations and incorporated their findings into his design.</li>
                        <li>Construction work started in July 1954. American Broadcasting Company (ABC)‍ agreed to help fund Disneyland. ABC broadcast Walt Disney's Disneyland, an anthology consisting of animated cartoons, live-action features and other material from the studio's library. The show was successful in terms of ratings and profits, earning an audience share of over 50%.</li>
                        <li>Disneyland opened in July 1955; the opening ceremony was broadcast on ABC, which reached 70 million viewers.</li>
                        <li>As well as the construction of Disneyland, Disney worked on other projects away from the studio. He was consultant to the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow; Disney Studios' contribution was America the Beautiful, a 19-minute film in the 360-degree Circarama theater that was one of the most popular attractions.</li>
                        <li> The following year he acted as the chairman of the Pageantry Committee for the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley, California, where he designed the opening, closing and medal ceremonies.</li>
                        <li>Despite the demands wrought by non-studio projects, Disney continued to work on film and television projects. In 1955, he was involved in "Man in Space", an episode of the Disneyland series, which was made in collaboration with NASA rocket designer Wernher von Braun.</li>
                        <li>Disney also oversaw aspects of the full-length features Lady and the Tramp (the first animated film in CinemaScope) in 1955, Sleeping Beauty (the first animated film in Technirama 70 mm film) in 1959, One Hundred and One Dalmatians (the first animated feature film to use Xerox cels) in 1961, and The Sword in the Stone in 1963.</li>
                        <li>In 1964, Disney produced Mary Poppins, based on the book series by P. L. Travers; he had been trying to acquire the rights to the story since the 1940s. It became the most successful Disney film of the 1960s.</li>
                        <li>Also in 1964, Disney also became involved in plans to expand the California Institute of the Arts (colloquially called CalArts), and had an architect draw up blueprints for a new building.</li>
                        <li>Disney provided four exhibits for the 1964 New York World's Fair, for which he obtained funding from selected corporate sponsors. For PepsiCo, Disney developed It's a Small World; Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln contained an animatronic Abraham Lincoln giving excerpts from his speeches; Carousel of Progress promoted the importance of electricity; and Ford's Magic Skyway portrayed the progress of mankind.</li>
                        <li>During the early to mid-1960s, Disney developed plans for a ski resort in Mineral King, a glacial valley in California's Sierra Nevada.</li>
                        <li>In late 1965, Disney announced plans to develop another theme park to be called "Disney World" (now Walt Disney World), a few miles southwest of Orlando, Florida. Disney World was to include the "Magic Kingdom"‍—‌a larger and more elaborate version of Disneyland. The heart of Disney World was to be the "Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow"</li>

                    <h3>Illness, death and aftermath</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Disney had been a heavy smoker since World War I. He did not use cigarettes with filters and had smoked a pipe as a young man. In November 1966, he was diagnosed with lung cancer and was treated with cobalt therapy.</li>
                        <li>On November 30 he felt unwell and was taken to St. Joseph Hospital where, on December 15, ten days after his 65th birthday, he died of circulatory collapse caused by lung cancer.</li>
                        <li>The release of The Jungle Book and The Happiest Millionaire in 1967 raised the total number of feature films that Disney had been involved in to 81.</li>
                        <li>When Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day was released in 1968, it earned Disney an Academy Award in the Short Subject (Cartoon) category, awarded posthumously.</li>
                        <li>After Disney's death, his studios continued to produce live-action films prolifically but largely abandoned animation until the late 1980s, after which there was what The New York Times describes as the "Disney Renaissance" that began with The Little Mermaid (1989).</li>
                        <li>Disney's plans for the futuristic city of EPCOT did not come to fruition. After Disney's death, his brother Roy deferred his retirement to take full control of the Disney companies. He changed the focus of the project from a town to an attraction.[154] At the inauguration in 1971, Roy dedicated Walt Disney World to his brother.</li>
                        <li>Walt Disney World expanded with the opening of Epcot Center in 1982; Walt Disney's vision of a functional city was replaced by a park more akin to a permanent world's fair.</li>
                        <li>In 2009, the Walt Disney Family Museum, designed by Disney's daughter Diane and her son Walter E. D. Miller, opened in the Presidio of San Francisco.</li>
